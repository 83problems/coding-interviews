# coding-interviews

This repository is used to learn more about Algorithms and Data Structures in Python to help solve the many challenging LeetCode problems. This repository was inspired by [vinta](https://github.com/vinta/fuck-coding-interviews).

## The Learning

- Algorithms
  - Searching
    - [Binary Search](https://github.com/83problems/coding-interviews/blob/main/algorithms/searching/binary_search.py)
- Data Structures


## Tests

What's code without some tests?

```bash
python -m unittest algorithms/searching/tests/test_binary_search.py
```
