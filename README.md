# coding-interviews

This repository is used to learn more about Algorithms and Data Structures in Python to help solve the many challenging LeetCode problems. This repository was inspired by [vinta](https://github.com/vinta/fuck-coding-interviews).

## The Learning

- Algorithms
  - Searching
    - [Binary Search](https://github.com/83problems/coding-interviews/blob/main/algorithms/searching/binary_search.py)
- Data Structures
- Coding Problems
  - HashMap
    - [Easy] [Two Sum](https://github.com/83problems/leetcode/tree/main/two-sum)
  - Set
    - [Easy] [Contains Duplicate](https://github.com/83problems/leetcode/tree/main/contains-duplicate)
  - Sorting
    - [Easy] [Palindrome Number](https://github.com/83problems/leetcode/tree/main/palindrome-number)
  - String
    - [Easy] [Valid Anagram](https://github.com/83problems/leetcode/tree/main/valid-anagram)
  - Tow Pointers
    - [Easy] [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://github.com/83problems/leetcode/tree/main/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock)


## Tests

What's code without some tests?

```bash
python -m unittest algorithms/searching/tests/test_binary_search.py
```
